title: The best albums of 2018

# 2018
2018, a new start? It has been for me. I started a new job. I moved country. I learned a lot. One of the things I learnt is how to build a website. This little blog, built in the [JAM-Stack](https://jamstack.org/) is my first public showcase of that. If you wish to know more about how it was built, please see the about page up top. Or of course you can ask me.

# The albums that matter
But of course I wouldn't have created this whole mess if I wasn't completely obsessed about making music related lists. Here you will find my favourite albums of the year 2018.

| Artist        | Album           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Ghost         | Prequelle |
| Confidence Man      | Confident Music for Confident People      |
