title: My most-listened albums of 2018
---
## Hooray Last.fm
You could say that I love Last.fm. Well, specifically the fact that it measures my exact listening behaviour down to the single song. This lets me complement my yearly favourite album list with an I would say more telling list: the most-listened albums of the year.

## A lot of new stuff
Although it hasn't produced any "instant classics" for me, 2018 was a good year musically, and that is reflected in my most listened albums. This might actually be a first with the amount of "new" albums in this list: a whopping nine out of ten!

|| Artist        | Album           |Year|
|| ------------- |-------------|------------|
|1|DJ Koze         | Knock Knock |2018|
|2|Judas Priest      | Firepower  |2018|
|3|Hot Snakes | Jericho Sirens      |2018|
|4|Ghost|Prequelle|2018|
|5|Kamasi Washington|Heaven & Earth|2018|
|6|Amorphis|Queen of Time|2018|
|7|Chrome Sparks|Chrome Sparks|2018|
|8|Pink Floyd|The Wall|1979|
|9|Ross From Friends|Family Portrait|2018|
|10|Gang Gang Dance|Kazuashita|2018|
|10|Underoath|Erase Me|2018|

Funny enough, like in my last list I have a shared number 10 spot (118 scrobbles each).

## More lists!
...and of course, more lists on the way! I am also thinking of ways to combine lists in interesting ways, any input is always appreciated!
