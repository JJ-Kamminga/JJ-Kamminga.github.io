title: The best albums of 2018
---
### 2018
2018, a new start? It has been for me. I started a new job. I moved country. I learned a lot. One of the things I learnt is how to build a website. This little blog, built in the [JAM-Stack](https://jamstack.org/) is my first public showcase of that. If you wish to know more about how it was built, please see the about page up top. Or of course you can ask me.

### The albums that matter
But of course I wouldn't have created this whole mess if I wasn't completely obsessed about making music related lists. Here you will find my favourite albums of the year 2018.

|| Artist        | Album           |
|| ------------- |-------------|
|1|Ghost         | Prequelle |
|2|Confidence Man      | Confident Music for Confident People      |
|3|Kamasi Washington | Heaven & Earth      |
|4|Hot Snakes|Jericho Sirens|
|5|U.S. Girls|In a Poem Unlimited|
|6|Go March|II|
|7|Between the Buried and Me|Automata I & II|
|8|Amorphis|Queen of Time|
|9|DJ Koze|Knock Knock|
|10|Gang Gang Dance|Kazuashita|
|10|Judas Priest|Firepower|

The choice between the two contestants for 10th place was too hard, so I decided not give them both a spot.

### More lists!
I will try to organise this blog one list per post. So, in the coming weeks I want to make some more lists for 2018, for example:
* My most listened albums of 2018
* The best songs of 2018
* The most disappointing albums of 2018
And many more...

What do you think of my list? And what do you think of the site? Please let me know!
